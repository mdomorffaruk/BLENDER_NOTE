## Blender Basic 
- **Movement**
	- Middle mouse click + drag = Rotate the view 
	- Shift + middle mouse click + drag = Move the view
	- Mouse wheel scroll = Zoom in , Zoom Out
- **Mode**
	- Object Mode
		- Select object
		- Shade and other options
	- Edit Mode: You can not select any object.
		- Vertices select
		- Edge select
		- Face select
	- `[Tab]` will toggle within object mode and edit mode
- **Shortcut Keys:**
	- `e` = Extrude
	- `g` = Grab
	- `s` = Scale
	- `r` = Rotate; Hold `Ctrl` to rotate in degrees, or type the degree. i.e 90 
	- `i` = Inset; Take a single phase and add a loop around that phase
	- `Ctrl + r` = Loop Cut + Scroll to add more/less loop-cut; Adding more geometry
	- `gg` = Select loop and slide
	- `Ctrl + b` = Bavel (Select all edge by pressing `Alt` + one edge, then bavel, move the mouse, then scroll to add more bavel line)
	- `Shift + a` = Add menu
	- `F9` = Get back the Last used function, only appear if you didn't change anything. 
	- `Shift + d` = Duplicate selected
	- `x` = Lock the edit only in x axis
	- `y` = Lock the edit only in y axis
	- `z` = Lock the edit only in z axis
	- `Alt + r` = Clear rotation
	- `Shift + n` = Clear normals
	- **Number pad**
		- `perod(.)` = move view to the selected object. Object must be selected here
		- `0` = Camera perspective
		- `1` = -y axis view
		- `3` = x axis view
		- `7` = z axis view
		- `9` = -z axis view
		- `5` = Remove the grid; Orthographic view
		- `4,6` = Rotate the view: right, left
		- `8,2` = Rotate the view: up,down
		- `+,-` = When save, add number after the file-name.
- **Modifier:** Are not actually adjust the real mesh; NON DISTRACTIVE WORKFLOW; Click apply to apply it permanently with the mesh.
		- `Solidify` = Ad thickness to object(Click `Add Mdifier`/ Settings icon on the right side, goto `Generate`, find solidify or search); 
		- `Subdivision Surface` = Average the corners point. Rounding the edges...
		- 
- **Steps:** 
	- Got to edit mode, select any vertices/edges/faces, use any keys to modify(e/g/s/r), modify using mouse/lock modify in one axis(x,y,z),
